# Godot-destructable-terrain
I made a destructable planet type terrain using polygons in Godot. This is made in C#
This is highly inspired py https://github.com/matterda/godot-destructible-terrain which is made in GD so I kinda remade it in C# to make it faster.
Feel free to use and change anything.
